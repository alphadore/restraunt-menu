# 🍷 Horizon Menu UI

A fine-dining experience... minus the food.

This is my first attempt at designing a luxury-themed restaurant menu, complete with a sizzling video background, elegant starters, and a cheeky booking page that politely tells you to go away (for now). Think upscale fonts, dramatic layout, and just enough flair to make you wonder if you should be wearing a tux while browsing.

### ✨ Features
- Video background for ambiance
- Elegant layout with stylish typography
- Playful “Book Your Seat” link with a placeholder twist
- Clean HTML/CSS structure for easy customization

### 🚀 Live Demo
Coming soon via GitHub Pages!

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- CSS

### 📬 Feedback
Fork it, star it, or just drop a food pun. I’m learning and experimenting—every bit of feedback helps!
